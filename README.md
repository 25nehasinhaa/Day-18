Hirst Painting Project:
Welcome to the Hirst Painting Project! This repository contains code that generates artistic dot paintings inspired by the works of British artist Damien Hirst.

Project Overview:
Damien Hirst is renowned for his series of "spot paintings," which consist of rows of colored dots. This project aims to recreate the essence of these iconic paintings using Python.

Features:
Random Color Generation: Each dot in the painting is assigned a random color, ensuring a unique artwork every time you run the code.
Customizable Grid: You can adjust the number of dots and the spacing between them to create different styles of paintings.
High-Resolution Output: The generated paintings are saved as high-resolution images, suitable for printing or digital display.
Simple and Clean Code: The project is designed to be easy to understand and modify, even for beginners.
