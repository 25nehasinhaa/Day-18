Hirst Painting Project:
Welcome to the Hirst Painting Project! This repository contains code that generates artistic dot paintings inspired by the works of British artist Damien Hirst.

Overview of the Project: 
Damien Hirst is well-known for his "spot paintings," which are made up of rows of coloured dots. The goal of this project is to use Python to capture the spirit of these famous paintings.

Features:
Random Colour Generation: Every dot in the painting is given a different colour at random, thus each time the code is executed, the artwork is different.
Customisable Grid: You can create a variety of painting styles by varying the number of dots and their spacing.
High-Resolution Output: The paintings that are produced can be printed or viewed digitally because they are saved as high-resolution pictures.
Clean and Simple Code: Even for novices, the project is made to be simple to comprehend and adjust.
